## Motivation
As we know, in basketball, contested shots all have lower FG% than open shots. Currently, the ways of looking at a shot (FG%, Offensive/Defensive Ratings) reflect the binary result of shots. However, what are the factors that lead to those binary results? And what does "contest" really mean?

As shown in previous [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00822), it is shown that the arcs of contested shots are generally differnet from those of open shots. More consistent release angles lead to a higher shooting percantage.

## Methodology
We are given the ball tracking data of twelve NCAA games provided by Shot Tracker.
